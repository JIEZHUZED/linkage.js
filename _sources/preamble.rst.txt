Preamble and Conventions
========================

This documentation specifies the requirements for LinkageJS software: *a graphical user interface for editing Modelica models of HVAC and control systems*.

It is intended to be mainly used as a discussion basis with the software development team.
Therefore the proposed design should not be considered finalized and will evolve during the iteration process with the development team.

Most of the concepts used to develop that specification are defined in the Modelica Language Specification :cite:`Modelica2017`.
