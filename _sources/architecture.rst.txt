Software Architecture
---------------------

:numref:`linkage_architecture_legend` to :numref:`linkage_architecture_os` provide architecture diagrams for the three integration targets.
Those are not hard and fast. They rather aim at illustrating the data workflow and describing the main modules to develop, and how they interface with LBL or third party developments.

The following definitions and conventions are used.

  Config data: pieces of data provided as input to the configuration widget, see :numref:`sec_data_model` for definitions and :numref:`sec_annex_json` for an actual example.

  Model data: pieces of data used by the graphical editor to allow manipulating a Modelica model. Those correspond to the Modelica code as interpreted by the editor according to its specific data model.

  Return *<arg>*: describes the translating task from one language (e.g. Modelica or Brick) or one data model (e.g. Modelica raw code or JSON) to another, specified as *<arg>*.

  Input: describes the user action of setting a parameter value through mouse or keyboard input.

  Call >> return *<arg>*: describes a bidirectional task where a component A calls another component B, and B returns *<arg>* to A.
